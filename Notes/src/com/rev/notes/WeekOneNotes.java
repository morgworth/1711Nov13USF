	Definitions for lms testing Monday: 

		Polymorphism
		From one; many. The ability to use a class to derive many different uses based on the current need. 
		As described by Oracle.docs: Subclasses of a class can define their own unique behaviors and yet share some of the same functionality of the parent class. 
		https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/polymorphism.html




		There Is Overriding and Overloading.

		 Overloading: there are several methods present in a class having the same name but different types/order/  or number of parameters. 
		Static polymorphism in Java is achieved by method overloading
		 Overriding:  

		Dynamic polymorphism in Java is achieved by method overriding


		APIE of OOPs programming

		Abstraction
		The process of hiding details while still showing essential functionality of an object.
		Only the functionality will be shown to the user. 
		Polymorphism
		From one, many. The super class can derive many forms from the subclasses based on a given need.

		Inheritance https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/subclasses.html
		Classes can be derived from other classes. 
		Encapsulation: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/object.html
		Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication. Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods

		Abstract class    http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-abstract-class-and-interface-in-java/
		Abstract classes extends a superclass or sub class

		Interface class   http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-abstract-class-and-interface-in-java/
		Interface class implements a superclass or sub class. 

		What is a package: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/package.html
		A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.

		Serializable: 	https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jndi/objects/serial.html
		To serialize an object means to convert its state to a byte stream so that the byte stream can be reverted back into a copy of the object

		Marker interface: 	https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/rmi/designing.html	 
		For an object to be considered serializable, its class must implement the java.io.Serializablemarker interface. Therefore, classes that implement the Task interface must also implement Serializable, as must the classes of objects used for task results.
